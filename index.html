The internet was a place that I always thought of as special and magical. <br>
A place where people were free to explore . . .<br>
free to express . . .<br>
free to connect . . .<br>
(where I was able to enter disney.com or nickelodeon.com and felt super cool)<br>
Where websites took an eternity to load . . .<br>

And then came . . .<br>
Facebook.<br>
Then Instagram.<br>
Then Twitter.<br>
Then Tumblr.<br>
Then Snapchat.<br>
Then Instagram videos.<br>
Then. Then. Then. Then. Then. Then. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br>

Something he said that I thought was interesting was the idea of a website feeling homemade.<br>
Where websites do not need to look like the platforms we see today.<br>
And that websites can be anything, and should be anything.<br>
Learning from the aesthetics of giant corporations to then learn how to make
a website from scratch is a type of punk.<br>
<p></p>

<div id="body_text_3">
“There are people who are far younger than the web, who never knew a 
world without the internet. If a teen is drawn to early web aesthetics, 
it is not out of nostalgia for their youth, it is instead a yearning 
for a time from before they even existed, a time they can only imagine."<br>

“So building a website from scratch, with hard-coded gif
animations and a web-ring, is now part of the 
back-to-the-land tradition."<br></div>
